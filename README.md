# Curvetopia 2024 - Adobe GenSolve

**Welcome to Curvetopia 2024, where we bring order and beauty to the world of 2D curves!**

This project is designed to guide you through the fascinating process of identifying, regularizing, and beautifying various types of 2D curves. Whether you’re a developer, mathematician, or digital artist, Curvetopia offers the tools and techniques to transform complex shapes into aesthetically pleasing forms.

## Objective

The primary objective of Curvetopia 2024 is to create an end-to-end pipeline that converts raster images (e.g., PNG files) of line art into a sequence of smooth and connected curves, defined by cubic Bézier curves. The project focuses on:

- **Curve Regularization**: Identifying and smoothing curves in 2D Euclidean space.
- **Symmetry Exploration**: Detecting and enhancing symmetrical properties within curves.
- **Curve Completion**: Completing incomplete curves to create cohesive, natural shapes.

## Problem Description

Initially, we aim to develop a simplified solution where line art is presented as polylines—a sequence of points in 2D space. The input consists of these polylines, and the output will be another set of paths, enhanced with regularization, symmetry, and completion.

### Key Components

1. **Curve Regularization**:
   - **Objective**: Identify and regularize common geometric shapes such as straight lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, and polygons.
   - **Challenge**: Distinguishing between regular and irregular shapes and smoothing them accordingly.
   - **Use Case**: Hand-drawn shapes and doodles.

2. **Exploring Symmetry**:
   - **Objective**: Identify reflection symmetries in closed curves.
   - **Challenge**: Detecting symmetrical properties and fitting Bézier curves to symmetrical points.

3. **Completing Incomplete Curves**:
   - **Objective**: Develop algorithms to naturally complete 2D curves with gaps or missing segments.
   - **Challenge**: Handling various levels of curve occlusion and ensuring the completed curves maintain smoothness and regularity.

### Input and Output

- **Input**: A set of polylines representing curves in 2D space. Initially, this input is derived from line art in PNG format, but simplified to point sequences.
- **Output**: Enhanced paths with regularization, symmetry, and curve completion, rendered as cubic Bézier curves. Visualization can be done using SVG format, which is browser-compatible.

## Visualization

For effective visualization, we use the SVG format, which allows rendering in web browsers. The output curves will be represented as cubic Bézier curves rather than simple polylines, providing a more refined and aesthetically pleasing result.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Curvetopia2024.git
    cd Curvetopia2024
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Regularization Script**:
    ```bash
    python regularize_curves.py
    ```

4. **Visualize Results**:
    - Use the provided visualization scripts to render and view the output curves.

## Expected Results

The final outputs will include:
- **Isolated Curves**: Single polylines representing isolated geometric shapes, regularized and beautified.
- **Fragmented Shapes**: Complex shapes composed of multiple polylines, enhanced with symmetry and regularization.
- **Completed Curves**: Incomplete curves filled in a natural and aesthetically pleasing manner.
